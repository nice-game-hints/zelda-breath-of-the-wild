Finding the shrine is the actual puzzle.

# Visit
Have you visited Calora Lake?

# Yes?
Did you meet Kass there? You can find him if you listen closely.

# Where is he?
Find him next to the big tree pn the east shore of Calora Lake.

# I found him
His song was nice. And it sure is bad weather here.

# It's lightning
That weird mould Kass pointed to is the key.

# What about it?
You sgould get lightning to hit it.

# How
Easiest way is to drop a metallic weapon on top of it. Remember to get out of the way!
