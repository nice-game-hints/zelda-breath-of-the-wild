The Ishto Soh shrine is located on a plateau west of Oseira Plains at Faron Grasslands.

# Breavery's Grasp
There is the control crystal that moves the pillars up and down.

# How to hit it?
You can hit it with a sword or arrows but not from the way up to the shrine.

# Chests
Did you get both of the treasurce chests? Did you spot the laser?

# Laser
The laser would switch the control crystal.

# But how?
Pick up the laser and land it on the moving platform. It will periodically hit the control crystal.
