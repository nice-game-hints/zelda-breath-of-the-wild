# Hint 1
There is a place to upgrade your Sheikah slate, on the left.

# Hint 2
You got a rune to your slate that looks like a.. magnet?

# Hint 3
Now, magnets work to metal, right?

# Hint 4
There are two metallic doors on the floor. Activate the slate (LR) and point one of the doors and press (A).
Lift the door up.

# Hint 5
Nice, a hidden corridor.
But how to get past that wall. You can't climb it the slippery rocks in shrines. Except one of the rocks is not a rock.

# Hint 6
Use your slate again to remove the metallic block in the wall and push the rocks aside.

# Hint 7
Are you still alive?
You can now walk over the metallic bridge to access the treasure. Except there is a second gap without a bridge!

# Hint 8
Did I say _metallic_ bridge?

# Hint 9
Using your slate lift the metallic bridge and position it over the second gap.

# Hint 10
Now you are facing two _metallic_ doors. What to do...

# Hint 11
Again, with the slate grab one of the doors and open it.
